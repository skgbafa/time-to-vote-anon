# Time to vote, anon

## Introduction

This project is building a modular voting system that can be used to conduct elections in a secure and anonymous manner. It's comprised of a registration system and a voting system. The registration system is used to verify eligibility and register participants on chain and the voting system is used to collect ballots and tally the results in using a FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) compatible smart contract.

Registration is aimed to be widely compatible with various credentials and identity systems (both on and off-chain). The voting contract is designed to be modular and allow for different voting schemes to be implemented. The first implementation will be a simple single choice vote, but the contract is designed to be extensible to support more complex voting schemes.

The main goal is for digital elections that are straightforward to conduct and easy to verify. The system is designed to be as simple as possible, while still being secure and anonymous. 

Some potential use cases:

- A media organization running a vote limited to digital passport holders of a specific country
- Holders of a certain professional credential voting on a proposal that affects the industry
- Member of a network state voting on a proposal that affects the network
